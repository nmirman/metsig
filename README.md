# Analysis code for MET Significance.
# Branches to use:
   * master: vanilla significance.
   * fft_significance: should have FFT code as well as job parallelization scripts.  A merge of yimin_comment and nathan_fullshape.
   * yimin_comment: Yimin's final FFT code.
   * systematics: has code for systematics evaluations.  Needs to be cleaned up, be cautious when using.
   * nathan_pileup: for making ROC plots in bins of N vertices
